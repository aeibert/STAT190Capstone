Authors: Amelia Eibert, Jimmy Fiasche, Sam Trujillo

## Introduction

For our data analytics capstone, we worked with the Des Moines Area Relgious Council, which is a network of food pantries across the greater Des Moines area. We were provided with a visit dataset which included anonymized data from their intake system. One row for each individual in a household who visited a pantry that month from 2018-2024. We were also provided information about their Red Barrel Program, where they are able to receive donations through these barrels that are located in stores such as Hyvee, Fareway, or Cashsaver.

Visit Data:
- Annual Income, federal poverty level, income source, SNAP Household
- DOB, gender, race, ethnicity, family type
- Housing, Housing type, zip
- Location visited, date of visit

Red Barrel Data: 
- Store Name, Location
- Items Donated
- Value of donations

Questions:
- How many new visitors may they see?
- How do economic factors affect visits?
- Does Red Barrel Work?
- Where can they add more Red Barrels?
